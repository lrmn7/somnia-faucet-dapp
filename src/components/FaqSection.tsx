          The{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-brand-orange">Multi Send</span>{" "}
          feature lets you send STT testnet tokens to multiple recipient
          addresses in a single transaction, saving you time and gas fees
          compared to sending individually. You can either paste a
          comma-separated list of addresses directly into the text area or
          upload an{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-brand-orange">
            XLSX (Excel) file
          </span>
          . When uploading an XLSX file, the dApp will automatically read the
          wallet addresses from the{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-brand-orange">
            first column (Column A) of the first sheet

      q: "What's the difference between 'Amount Per Recipient' and 'Total Amount (Distribute)' in Multi Send?",
      a: (
        <>
          In Multi Send, you have two options for specifying the amount:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold text-brand-orange">
                Amount Per Recipient:
              </span>{" "}
              If you choose this, the amount you enter will be sent to *each*
              address in your recipient list. For example, if you enter "0.1"
              and have 5 recipients, each of the 5 recipients will receive 0.1
              STT, totaling 0.5 STT sent from your wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold text-brand-orange">
                Total Amount (Distribute):
              </span>{" "}
              With this option, the amount you enter will be *divided equally*
              among all recipients in your list. For example, if you enter "1.0"
              and have 5 recipients, each recipient will receive 0.2 STT (1.0
              divided by 5). Any remainder from the division (due to integer
              arithmetic) will be added to the first recipient's share to ensure
              the total amount is sent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Choose the option that best fits how you want to distribute tokens.

    {
      q: "Is this dApp safe to use?",
      a: (
        <>
          Absolutely. This dApp is completely safe and never asks for access to
          your private keys. The entire source code is open-source, and you can
